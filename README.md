Project Name: H&M Fashion Dashboard

Data Source:https://www.kaggle.com/c/h-and-m-personalized-fashion-recommendations/data

Project Background: H&M Group is a family of brands and businesses with 53 online markets and approximately 4,850 stores. Their online store offers shoppers an extensive selection of products to browse through. In this dashboard, I extract data with the date range 2020 Q1-Q2 from the whole dataset.

Goal: Help Business Partner track important KPIs such as sales performance metric and make a comparison from quarterly view.

Major Business Insights:
1. Index Group is the top-level segment for all the products. Among all the Index Groups, the Ladieswear product segment contributes the most revenue and increases most from Q1 to Q2.
2. Among all customers, active members contribute the most sales. Accordingly, they occupy the largest proportion of customers. However, in terms of average sales per customer, non-members are the highest one. Thus, converting non-members to active members to maintain their loyalty is an important task.
